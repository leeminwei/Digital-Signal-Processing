In DSP_graduate program,I removed three unwanted tones using simple FIR notch filters in MATLAB. The target frequencies were found using ginput on the spectrogram and FFT peak analysis.

In DSP_Undergraduate program, I explored how an FIR filter responds to different frequencies and how well it can filter out a 1200 Hz signal. By trying different sampling rates, I found that the choice of fs affects how effective the filter is at removing high-frequency components.
